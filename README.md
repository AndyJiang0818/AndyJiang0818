### Hi there :sun_with_face:

I'm Xihao (Andy) Jiang, who is interested in creating fun websites and applications.

- 🔭 Here is my capstone project, which is a website that connects the tenants and landlords; letting the tenants sumbit and edit a repair request; letting the landlords handle the repair requests, as well as post and edit announcements. [Check it out](https://dailytenant.herokuapp.com/).
